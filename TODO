TODO:
	* Fix thread handling and interrupts. Works very poorly at the moment, or... Not at all!

Packet parsing:
	- Handle packets who's data has been split into multiple packets because it was too big to fit in the first.
	- Lots of unhandled packets

Packet Sending:
	- No commands yet for sending.
	- Set up a basic prompt which will allow basic commands to be entered such as '/w player Hello' or '/whois player'. Get all of the methods for receiving and sending done before working on the UI.

Parser/deserializer:
	- Creates structures from the login info
		- Ignores
		- Banlists
		- Clan

HTTP Requester:
	- Missing methods, only one is complete at the moment.

Notifications
	- Much to do.

GUI
	- Much to do.

BUGS:
	None to be pinpointed ATM.
