#HoNChatPy.
A HoN chat client written in Python.

I stopped working on this project a few months back, it's in a weird state and I can't remember where I was going with it.

As I am no longer playing HoN I wish to release the code for this to the public so that they can learn from it and if they wish to, are
fully free to use it as they please.

## Requirements

* [PySide](http://www.pyside.org) - For the QT bindings.
* [HoNCore](http://github.com/Joev-/HoNCore) - For connectivity to the chat server.

## Usage

From the comman line run `python main.py`. Given all is okay, it should display a log in window.
